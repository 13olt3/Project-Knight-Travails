bounds are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7  [0 to 7]
for [x,y] 
if x + 1 => y must + or - 2
if x + 2 => y must + or - 1
if x - 1 => y must + or - 2
if x - 2 +> y must + or - 1

x and y cannot be bellow 0 and cannot be higher than 7

what kind of algorithm do I write?
How do I make sure, it's the fastest route?
odds and evens?

maybe biggest difference between  number => that gets the + - 2?

 a  b
 1  2
 1 -2
 2  1
 2 -1
-1  2
-1 -2
-2  1
-2 -1
